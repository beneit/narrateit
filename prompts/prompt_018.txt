Annotate the following <DOCUMENT_TYPE> for an audiobook performance script by identifying the speaker for each line of dialogue and distinguishing between dialogue and narration.

Known Speakers: Narration, <LIST_OF_SPEAKERS>, <Lennie>, <George>. New characters may appear.

Guidelines:
1. Include Narration like "he said" outside character speech in the narration speaker.
2. Copy original text exactly, except for quote removal.
3. Keep original order of text exactly

Now annotate:

Text: "<Lennie>!" <SUBJECT_PRONOUN_2> said sharply. "<Lennie>, for God’ sakes don’t drink so much." <Lennie> continued to snort into the pool. The small <GENDER_2> leaned over and shook <OBJECT_PRONOUN_1> by the shoulder. "<Lennie>. You gonna be sick like you was last night."

 "Yeah, what ya want?"  
 "Where we goin’, <George>?"  
 The little <GENDER_2> brought down the brim of <POSSESSIVE_ADJ_2> hat and scowled over  at <Lennie>. "So you forgot that awready, did you? I gotta tell you  again, do I? Jesus Christ, you’re a crazy person!"
